have one or more /rest endpoints receive a string token with @RequestHeader annotation so that the LoginFilter is working

maybe try to return a service through LoginController aswell as a token

inherited login method in controllers is not used

maybe unnecessary when we implement login tokens:

make sure admin has to login to use controller and service methods
some methods in company service you don't have to login to use
can't use controllers without logging in
